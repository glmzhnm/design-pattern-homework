# SOLID Adventure Game

## Overview
My project is a simple adventure game implemented in Java, following the SOLID principles for clean and maintainable code. My game consists of a player fighting enemies, collecting items, and progressing through levels.

## Features
- **Player Management:** Tracks player's health, experience, and inventory.
- **Combat System:** Handles battles between the player and different enemy types.
- **Item Management:** Allows the player to collect and use various items.
- **Level Progression:** Manages level transitions and game progression.
- **Score Tracking:** Displays final game results.

## SOLID Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** The system allows adding new enemies and items without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Derived classes (e.g., different enemies and items) extend base classes without altering expected behavior.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Items and enemies have distinct interfaces to prevent unnecessary dependencies.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; they rely on abstractions.
